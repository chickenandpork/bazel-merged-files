# rules_merged_files

I find I want to put individual files scattered across a repo, and then merge them during build time.  Today, it's pythonic starlark merged into a list of dicts, tomorrow, I'm sure it'll be sole JSON or YAML amalgamated and embedded into some GO (v1.16 or later, of course).

# What's here?

I should build out the basic sample of what i'm trying to do, then probably unittest it,  That would be great.
